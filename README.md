# GearScore-3.3.5:

Full version of the Gearscore addon which includes the database
For WoW 3.3.5a

**Whats new:**

- Adds average GearScore for party/raids. This can be viewed with new commands /gs party, /gs raid and /gs group (all the commands are same).
- Adds gems to inspect screen

**Fixes:**

- Fixed the jumping of talents and empty gear when inspecting (thanks to https://github.com/Arcitec)
- Removed depedency from BonusScanner which creates lot of lua errors and doesn't even work
